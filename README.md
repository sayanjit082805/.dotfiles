# .dotfiles
My set of dotfiles for the awesome window manager. Basically, just a giant amalgamation of other repositories. 

> [!Warning]
> These dotfiles are purely just a backup and a reference for when I might distro hop. **Please don't even try to install them as it would most likely just break all your existing configurations.** That being said, feel free to check out the repositories linked in the acknowledgement section. (I assume you already know about them if you have been searching for awesomewm configurations.)
